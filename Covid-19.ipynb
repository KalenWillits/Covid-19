        "We can see by the vertical line in the population plot that the amount of population infected is a small fraction of the entire US population. Another point that must be made is we are not measuring time. The number of people that have been recorded as infected are not the same as the number of people that are currently infectious. Although these are tens of thousands of people, this data shows that either [CDC preventative measures](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/county-map.html) are working or the Covid-19 virus is not as infectious as we have been made to believe, perhaps a mix of both.\n",
        "\n",
        "The infections plot carries a similar distribution to its parent populations plot. At a glance, we could say that the data that shows a higher population contributes to a higher number of people infected, until we get to Washington state. Washington appears to have less COVID-19 activity when compared to other states with similar populations. If we check the [states with the most aggressive counter measures to COVID-19](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/articles/2020-03-17/10-states-with-the-most-aggressive-response-to-coronavirus), Washington state ranks in 5th place. Some aggressive measures from [Washington state include a 4 step data-driven plan with excellent feature definitions](https://www.governor.wa.gov/sites/default/files/SafeStartPhasedReopening.pdf). Unfortunately, our New York Times data set does not show evidence that these aggressive measures have helped reduce the amount of COVID-19 activity based on the other 9 states from the US [News article](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/articles/2020-03-17/10-states-with-the-most-aggressive-response-to-coronavirus).\n",

        "When viewing the deaths chart, we should expect the amount of deaths reported to be strongly correlated with the amount of infections, however this is clearly not the case. Alaska reports deaths per infections as 0.5% and Connecticut has a reported death rate of 8.83%. There are arguments for both sides, either something is causing COVID-19 deaths to have a wide range of survival rates from state to state, or the reporting is incorrect. The data says that the average death rate in the US is nearly 3%, this is especially troubling when compared to [Germany's metric of 0.4%](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/24/opinions/germany-low-death-rate-for-coronavirus-sepkowitz/index.html). The argument in this article is that Germany has tested more of the population and found more infections that are asymptomatic resulting in a higher infection rate and lower death rate. This article from Fox News poses a theory that people who die with COVID-19 are being reported as a victim of COVID-19 and will be included in the deaths calculated in the New York Times data set."
